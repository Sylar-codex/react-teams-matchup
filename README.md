##### About

This project was built in React using this [React getting started documentation
](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Theme inspired by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

This app was built based off an argument between my friend Roz and I to find out who won between the Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves when they faced off. Finding the information through [land of basketball](https://www.landofbasketball.com) or [stats.nba.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/) proved to be difficult. So I built a simple app to solve a simple problem. Enjoy at your leisure.
